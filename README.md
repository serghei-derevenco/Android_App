## Implemented features:
So, for this laboratory work I continued to work on my Telegram clone. I have implemented the following features:
* Send images in chat (this feature is working only on real phone, I don't know the reason why emulator is not performing it).
* Send voice messages in chat.
* All the files are stored in database storage.
* I did a huge code refactoring for bringing my application to clear Single Activity Architecture.
