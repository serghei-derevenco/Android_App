### Author: *Serghei Derevenco*

## Implemented features:
So, for this laboratory work I continued to work on my Telegram clone. I have implemented the following features:
* I am using [Image Cropper API](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper) to crop user's profile images.
* All information that user changes in settings, now is updating in header of navigation bar.
* I have implemented new Contacts fragment, where is a list of user's contacts.
* By clicking on specific contact user will be redirected on other fragment (SingleChatFragment), where will be the private chat between user and contact.
* Users have posibility to send messages. Those messages are automatically stored in Firebase.
* Also when user sends or receives a messages, he will see the time when messages was sent.
* Here you can find a small screencast: https://youtu.be/QpZp9Wy7hl8
